# SketchFormer - Revolutionary Mesh Deformation Project implemented on web.

## Introduction
This is an implementation of SketchFormer (http://youtu.be/74rULDZlPl4) using processingjs.org

## How to compile/build/run
### Grab the latest Processing from http://www.processing.org/
### ```git clone https://github.com/whyi/SketchFormer.git```
### Open SketchFormer.pde from Processing, it will load all the other files together.
### Ctrl+R or [Sketch]-[Run In Browser] will bring this up!

## Unit testing
### SketchFormer uses Jasmine and Coffeescript as the framework for unittest.
### Have the SketchFormer running via Processing, as described in the previous section.
### Open a shell, execute runTests.sh
### Now, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:RUNNING_PROCESISNG_PORT/SpecRunner.html within the browser where the RUNNING_PROCESSING_PORT is the port number of a running Processing instance. This will be provided when you run the SketchFormer as described in the previous section.
